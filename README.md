# Asteroids
My second project following a course on [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-asteroids)
## Extending the project
### Ideas
- Add a scoring system :heavy_check_mark:
- Implement multiple lives and respawning
- Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
- Add acceleration to the player movement
- Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
- Add a background image
- Create different weapon types
- Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
- Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
- Add a shield power-up
- Add a speed power-up
- Add bombs that can be dropped
